# Handoff

The current agent overwrites the **Current handoff** section at the end of every session. Keep older sessions as short bullets under **History**.

## Current handoff

**Date:** 2026-09-09
**Branch:** `main`
**Mode:** Max-score Round 2. **Agent + tools required** (Applied AI). Geometry still classical.

### What changed this session

- Completed the media-independent **T10 engineering report draft** in `docs/writeup.md`.
- The 1,805-word draft covers architecture, tiers/devices, drift, error budget, calibration, agent/tool boundaries, fix loop, evidence tables, and hostile-scene failure modes.
- Exact current numbers come from the frozen synthetic eval and are labelled as contract evidence, not phone accuracy. Every real-capture table cell remains explicitly pending T3.
- Refreshed README, TASKS, compliance status, and this handoff so T20 is the next media-independent stage.

### What is true now

- Product: local CLI. Folder in → JSON + SVG out. No Redis, no our servers.
- Plane-anchored stitch + regenerable `floorplan.ablation-off.json` work on the two-room RoomPlan fixture. Drift gate passes when that ablation is supplied.
- Video jobs with a real/synthetic MP4 are ingested (frame count in the warning) but do **not** emit centimetres yet.
- Photo jobs validate one folder per room, 2–8 decodable images per folder, and stable room/image metadata. They intentionally remain `unsupported_tier` until metric reconstruction exists.
- Raw Record3D/USDZ still structured-fail.
- T19 before is pinned to `523ceea`; the shipped code is pinned to `68acdf6`. The complete bundle is under `data/fix-loop/`.
- The after run exits 0. Its eval still exits 3 because unrelated repeatability/incumbent evidence is missing, while the selected `pipeline_yield` gate passes.
- Bundle verification, all 57 tests, `ruff check .`, compileall, and diff checks pass.
- T10 is structurally drafted but remains `doing` until real LiDAR/video/photo, repeatability, incumbent, calibration, and timing evidence replaces the pending cells.

### Blockers

- Human T3 capture (photos, video, LiDAR, tape GT, Polycam/magicplan). Drop files under gitignored `data/private/` using `data/README.md`.
- Raw Record3D `.r3d`/metadata/depth for Route 2 LiDAR.
- T21: full Xcode.app (this machine has Command Line Tools only).
- Metric video VO and photo SfM/adjacency/interval calibration need the actual media.

### Next agent should

1. Execute the media-independent portion of **T20**: verify the README path on a clean environment and tighten the reproduction/compliance mapping without inventing measured rows.
2. If T3 files are present: implement metric **T7 VO** and/or **T8 photo** reconstruction against them.
3. Do not run T21 without Xcode.app.

### Read next (max five)

1. `TASKS.md`
2. `README.md`
3. `docs/compliance-matrix.md`
4. `docs/writeup.md`
5. `data/fix-loop/README.md`

### Exact next command

```text
Execute T20a: prove the documented synthetic setup/run/eval/fix-loop path from a clean temporary environment, then update README and compliance with the exact evidence. Do not fill capture-dependent rows.
```

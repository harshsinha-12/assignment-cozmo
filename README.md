# assignment-cozmo

Take-home for **Cozmo AI**: phone captures → **dimensioned, stitched floor plans** plus damage/scope JSON. Local CLI, not a website.

Official prompt: [`docs/takehome.md`](docs/takehome.md) (Round 2). What we are building: [`docs/product.md`](docs/product.md). **Score policy:** target every official row; cut only tomorrow night ([`docs/cut-later.md`](docs/cut-later.md)).

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Company | [Cozmo AI](https://www.hellocozmo.ai/) |
| Role | AI Backend Engineer |
| Recruiter | Brynz — saik@brynz.io |
| Capture phone | iPhone 17 Pro (LiDAR) |
| Official prompt | In repo — [`docs/takehome.md`](docs/takehome.md) |
| Agent contract | [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) |
| Current handoff | [`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md) |

## Start here

**Human (tonight):** capture the benchmark — [`docs/capture-protocol.md`](docs/capture-protocol.md). 3+ rooms + hallway, photos/video/LiDAR, two damage classes, tape, Polycam or magicplan on two rooms. Short list: [`START-TOMORROW.md`](START-TOMORROW.md).

**Agent:** [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) → [`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md) → [`update.md`](update.md) → [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md). Top code task is **T12** (schema). Do not pre-concede photo/video gates.

## Current status

**Phase 1 ingest done. Phase 2 (schema + red eval) is next. No reconstructor yet.**

See [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md).

## Setup (short)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
make test
```

Expected today: schema tests on the synthetic fixture. Pipeline `run` does not exist until T13.

## Design in one paragraph

One FloorPlan IR for photos, video, and LiDAR. One command emits JSON + SVG. Centimetres come from geometry. An **LLM agent with tools** fills damage, concealed-damage rules, and scope (disclosed public API + fallback). Eval reports official gates in centimetres.

## Ground rules

- Python 3.11+ (3.12 is fine).
- Deterministic jobs: same `job/` in, same JSON out.
- Headless tests (`opencv-python-headless`).
- No centimetre claims without eval numbers.
- No website, no Redis, no calls to **our** servers. Disclosed LLM API is required for the agent path (`docs/agent-layer.md`).
